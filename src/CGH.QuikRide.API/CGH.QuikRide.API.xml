             <remarks>
             This is private for a reason - using ILoggingService here in place of Log4NetLoggingService would be preferable.
             However, doing so causes the CallerMemberName and CallerFilePath attributes to return null.
             This is because those attributes are used by the compiler (not at runtime) to do their magic.
             Thus, by abstracting them in an interface the compiler cannot tell which methods are calling.
